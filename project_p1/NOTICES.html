<span class="s0">1. Definitions.</span>

   <span class="s0">the copyright owner that is granting the License.</span>

   <span class="s0">&quot;Legal Entity&quot; shall mean the union of the acting entity and all</span>
   <span class="s0">other entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common</span>
   <span class="s0">control with that entity. For the purposes of this definition,</span>
   <span class="s0">&quot;control&quot; means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the</span>

   <span class="s0">exercising permissions granted by this License.</span>

   <span class="s0">&quot;Source&quot; form shall mean the preferred form for making modifications,</span>

   <span class="s0">transformation or translation of a Source form, including but</span>
   <span class="s0">not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,</span>
   <span class="s0">and conversions to other media types.</span>

   <span class="s0">&quot;Work&quot; shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or</span>

   <span class="s0">&quot;Derivative Works&quot; shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object</span>

   <span class="s0">editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications</span>
   <span class="s0">represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes</span>
   <span class="s0">of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain</span>
   <span class="s0">separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,</span>
   <span class="s0">the Work and Derivative Works thereof.</span>

   <span class="s0">to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally</span>
   <span class="s0">submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner</span>
   <span class="s0">or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of</span>
   <span class="s0">the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, &quot;submitted&quot;</span>

   <span class="s0">to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to</span>
   <span class="s0">communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,</span>
   <span class="s0">and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the</span>
   <span class="s0">Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but</span>
   <span class="s0">excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise</span>
   <span class="s0">designated in writing by the copyright owner as &quot;Not a Contribution.&quot;</span>

   <span class="s0">&quot;Contributor&quot; shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity</span>
   <span class="s0">on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and</span>

<span class="s0">2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of</span>
   <span class="s0">this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,</span>
   <span class="s0">worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable</span>
   <span class="s0">copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,</span>
   <span class="s0">publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the</span>
   <span class="s0">Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.</span>

<span class="s0">3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of</span>
   <span class="s0">this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,</span>
   <span class="s0">worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable</span>
   <span class="s0">(except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,</span>
   <span class="s0">use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,</span>
   <span class="s0">where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable</span>
   <span class="s0">by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their</span>
   <span class="s0">Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)</span>
   <span class="s0">with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You</span>
   <span class="s0">institute patent litigation against any entity (including a</span>
   <span class="s0">cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work</span>
   <span class="s0">or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct</span>
   <span class="s0">or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses</span>
   <span class="s0">granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate</span>
   <span class="s0">as of the date such litigation is filed.</span>

<span class="s0">4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the</span>
   <span class="s0">Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without</span>
   <span class="s0">modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You</span>
   <span class="s0">meet the following conditions:</span>

   <span class="s0">(a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or</span>
       <span class="s0">Derivative Works a copy of this License; and</span>

   <span class="s0">(b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices</span>
       <span class="s0">stating that You changed the files; and</span>

   <span class="s0">(c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works</span>
       <span class="s0">that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and</span>
       <span class="s0">attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,</span>
       <span class="s0">excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of</span>
       <span class="s0">the Derivative Works; and</span>

   <span class="s0">(d) If the Work includes a &quot;NOTICE&quot; text file as part of its</span>
       <span class="s0">distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must</span>
       <span class="s0">include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained</span>
       <span class="s0">within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not</span>
       <span class="s0">pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one</span>
       <span class="s0">of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed</span>
       <span class="s0">as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or</span>
       <span class="s0">documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,</span>
       <span class="s0">within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and</span>
       <span class="s0">wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents</span>
       <span class="s0">of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and</span>
       <span class="s0">do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution</span>
       <span class="s0">notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside</span>
       <span class="s0">or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided</span>
       <span class="s0">that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed</span>
       <span class="s0">as modifying the License.</span>

   <span class="s0">You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and</span>
   <span class="s0">may provide additional or different license terms and conditions</span>
   <span class="s0">for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or</span>
   <span class="s0">for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,</span>
   <span class="s0">reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with</span>
   <span class="s0">the conditions stated in this License.</span>

<span class="s0">5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,</span>
   <span class="s0">any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work</span>
   <span class="s0">by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of</span>
   <span class="s0">this License, without any additional terms or conditions.</span>
   <span class="s0">Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify</span>
   <span class="s0">the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed</span>
   <span class="s0">with Licensor regarding such Contributions.</span>

<span class="s0">6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade</span>
   <span class="s0">names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,</span>
   <span class="s0">except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the</span>
   <span class="s0">origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.</span>

<span class="s0">7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or</span>
   <span class="s0">agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each</span>
   <span class="s0">Contributor provides its Contributions) on an &quot;AS IS&quot; BASIS,</span>
   <span class="s0">WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or</span>
   <span class="s0">implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions</span>
   <span class="s0">of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A</span>
   <span class="s0">PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the</span>
   <span class="s0">appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any</span>
   <span class="s0">risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.</span>

<span class="s0">8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,</span>
   <span class="s0">whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,</span>
   <span class="s0">unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly</span>
   <span class="s0">negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be</span>
   <span class="s0">liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,</span>
   <span class="s0">incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a</span>
   <span class="s0">result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the</span>
   <span class="s0">Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,</span>
   <span class="s0">work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all</span>
   <span class="s0">other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor</span>
   <span class="s0">has been advised of the possibility of such damages.</span>

<span class="s0">9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing</span>
   <span class="s0">the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,</span>
   <span class="s0">and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,</span>
   <span class="s0">or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this</span>
   <span class="s0">License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only</span>
   <span class="s0">on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf</span>
   <span class="s0">of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,</span>
   <span class="s0">defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability</span>
   <span class="s0">incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason</span>
   <span class="s0">of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.</span>

   <span class="s0">where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable</span>
   <span class="s0">by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their</span>
   <span class="s0">Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)</span>
   <span class="s0">with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You</span>
   <span class="s0">institute patent litigation against any entity (including a</span>
   <span class="s0">cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work</span>
   <span class="s0">or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct</span>
   <span class="s0">or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses</span>
   <span class="s0">granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate</span>
   <span class="s0">as of the date such litigation is filed.</span>

<span class="s0">4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the</span>
   <span class="s0">Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without</span>
   <span class="s0">modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You</span>
   <span class="s0">meet the following conditions:</span>

   <span class="s0">(a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or</span>
       <span class="s0">Derivative Works a copy of this License; and</span>

   <span class="s0">(b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices</span>
       <span class="s0">stating that You changed the files; and</span>

   <span class="s0">(c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works</span>
       <span class="s0">that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and</span>
       <span class="s0">attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,</span>
       <span class="s0">excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of</span>
       <span class="s0">the Derivative Works; and</span>

   <span class="s0">(d) If the Work includes a &quot;NOTICE&quot; text file as part of its</span>
       <span class="s0">distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must</span>
       <span class="s0">include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained</span>
       <span class="s0">within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not</span>
       <span class="s0">pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one</span>
       <span class="s0">of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed</span>
       <span class="s0">as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or</span>
       <span class="s0">documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,</span>
       <span class="s0">within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and</span>
       <span class="s0">wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents</span>
       <span class="s0">of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and</span>
       <span class="s0">do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution</span>
       <span class="s0">notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside</span>
       <span class="s0">or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided</span>
       <span class="s0">that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed</span>
       <span class="s0">as modifying the License.</span>

   <span class="s0">You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and</span>
   <span class="s0">may provide additional or different license terms and conditions</span>
   <span class="s0">for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or</span>
   <span class="s0">for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,</span>
   <span class="s0">reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with</span>
   <span class="s0">the conditions stated in this License.</span>

<span class="s0">5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,</span>
   <span class="s0">any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work</span>
   <span class="s0">by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of</span>
   <span class="s0">this License, without any additional terms or conditions.</span>
   <span class="s0">Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify</span>
   <span class="s0">the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed</span>
   <span class="s0">with Licensor regarding such Contributions.</span>

<span class="s0">6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade</span>
   <span class="s0">names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,</span>
   <span class="s0">except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the</span>
   <span class="s0">origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.</span>

<span class="s0">7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or</span>
   <span class="s0">agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each</span>
   <span class="s0">Contributor provides its Contributions) on an &quot;AS IS&quot; BASIS,</span>
   <span class="s0">WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or</span>
   <span class="s0">implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions</span>
   <span class="s0">of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A</span>
   <span class="s0">PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the</span>
   <span class="s0">appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any</span>
   <span class="s0">risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.</span>

<span class="s0">8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,</span>
   <span class="s0">whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,</span>
   <span class="s0">unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly</span>
   <span class="s0">negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be</span>
   <span class="s0">liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,</span>
   <span class="s0">incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a</span>
   <span class="s0">result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the</span>
   <span class="s0">Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,</span>
   <span class="s0">work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all</span>
   <span class="s0">other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor</span>
   <span class="s0">has been advised of the possibility of such damages.</span>

<span class="s0">9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing</span>
   <span class="s0">the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,</span>
   <span class="s0">and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,</span>
   <span class="s0">or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this</span>
   <span class="s0">License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only</span>
   <span class="s0">on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf</span>
   <span class="s0">of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,</span>
   <span class="s0">defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability</span>
   <span class="s0">incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason</span>
   <span class="s0">of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.</span>

<span class="s0">END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS</span>

<span class="s0">The FreeType Project LICENSE</span>

        <span class="s0">2006-Jan-27</span>

<span class="s0">Copyright 1996-2002, 2006 by</span>
<span class="s0">David Turner, Robert Wilhelm, and Werner Lemberg</span>

<span class="s0">Introduction</span>
<span class="s0">============</span>

  <span class="s0">The FreeType  Project is distributed in  several archive packages;</span>
  <span class="s0">some of them may contain, in addition to the FreeType font engine,</span>
  <span class="s0">various tools and  contributions which rely on, or  relate to, the</span>
  <span class="s0">FreeType Project.</span>

  <span class="s0">This  license applies  to all  files found  in such  packages, and</span>
  <span class="s0">which do not  fall under their own explicit  license.  The license</span>
  <span class="s0">affects  thus  the  FreeType   font  engine,  the  test  programs,</span>
  <span class="s0">documentation and makefiles, at the very least.</span>

  <span class="s0">This  license   was  inspired  by  the  BSD,   Artistic,  and  IJG</span>
  <span class="s0">(Independent JPEG  Group) licenses, which  all encourage inclusion</span>
  <span class="s0">and  use of  free  software in  commercial  and freeware  products</span>
  <span class="s0">alike.  As a consequence, its main points are that:</span>

    <span class="s0">o We don't promise that this software works. However, we will be</span>
      <span class="s0">interested in any kind of bug reports. (`as is' distribution)</span>

    <span class="s0">o You can  use this software for whatever you  want, in parts or</span>
      <span class="s0">full form, without having to pay us. (`royalty-free' usage)</span>

    <span class="s0">o You may not pretend that  you wrote this software.  If you use</span>
      <span class="s0">it, or  only parts of it,  in a program,  you must acknowledge</span>
      <span class="s0">somewhere  in  your  documentation  that  you  have  used  the</span>
      <span class="s0">FreeType code. (`credits')</span>

  <span class="s0">We  specifically  permit  and  encourage  the  inclusion  of  this</span>
  <span class="s0">software, with  or without modifications,  in commercial products.</span>
  <span class="s0">We  disclaim  all warranties  covering  The  FreeType Project  and</span>
  <span class="s0">assume no liability related to The FreeType Project.</span>

  <span class="s0">Finally,  many  people  asked  us  for  a  preferred  form  for  a</span>
  <span class="s0">credit/disclaimer to use in compliance with this license.  We thus</span>
  <span class="s0">encourage you to use the following text:</span>

    <span class="s0">Portions of this software are copyright © &lt;year&gt; The FreeType</span>
    <span class="s0">Project (www.freetype.org).  All rights reserved.</span>

  <span class="s0">Please replace &lt;year&gt; with the value from the FreeType version you</span>
  <span class="s0">actually use.</span>

<span class="s0">Legal Terms</span>
<span class="s0">===========</span>

<span class="s0">0. Definitions</span>

  <span class="s0">Throughout this license,  the terms `package', `FreeType Project',</span>
  <span class="s0">and  `FreeType  archive' refer  to  the  set  of files  originally</span>
  <span class="s0">distributed  by the  authors  (David Turner,  Robert Wilhelm,  and</span>
  <span class="s0">Werner Lemberg) as the `FreeType Project', be they named as alpha,</span>
  <span class="s0">beta or final release.</span>

  <span class="s0">`You' refers to  the licensee, or person using  the project, where</span>
  <span class="s0">`using' is a generic term including compiling the project's source</span>
  <span class="s0">code as  well as linking it  to form a  `program' or `executable'.</span>
  <span class="s0">This  program is  referred to  as  `a program  using the  FreeType</span>
  <span class="s0">engine'.</span>

  <span class="s0">This  license applies  to all  files distributed  in  the original</span>
  <span class="s0">FreeType  Project,   including  all  source   code,  binaries  and</span>
  <span class="s0">documentation,  unless  otherwise  stated   in  the  file  in  its</span>
  <span class="s0">original, unmodified form as  distributed in the original archive.</span>
  <span class="s0">If you are  unsure whether or not a particular  file is covered by</span>
  <span class="s0">this license, you must contact us to verify this.</span>

  <span class="s0">The FreeType  Project is copyright (C) 1996-2000  by David Turner,</span>
  <span class="s0">Robert Wilhelm, and Werner Lemberg.  All rights reserved except as</span>
  <span class="s0">specified below.</span>

<span class="s0">1. No Warranty</span>

  <span class="s0">THE FREETYPE PROJECT  IS PROVIDED `AS IS' WITHOUT  WARRANTY OF ANY</span>
  <span class="s0">KIND, EITHER  EXPRESS OR IMPLIED,  INCLUDING, BUT NOT  LIMITED TO,</span>
  <span class="s0">WARRANTIES  OF  MERCHANTABILITY   AND  FITNESS  FOR  A  PARTICULAR</span>
  <span class="s0">PURPOSE.  IN NO EVENT WILL ANY OF THE AUTHORS OR COPYRIGHT HOLDERS</span>
  <span class="s0">BE LIABLE  FOR ANY DAMAGES CAUSED  BY THE USE OR  THE INABILITY TO</span>
  <span class="s0">USE, OF THE FREETYPE PROJECT.</span>

<span class="s0">2. Redistribution</span>

  <span class="s0">This  license  grants  a  worldwide, royalty-free,  perpetual  and</span>
  <span class="s0">irrevocable right  and license to use,  execute, perform, compile,</span>
  <span class="s0">display,  copy,   create  derivative  works   of,  distribute  and</span>
  <span class="s0">sublicense the  FreeType Project (in  both source and  object code</span>
  <span class="s0">forms)  and  derivative works  thereof  for  any  purpose; and  to</span>
  <span class="s0">authorize others  to exercise  some or all  of the  rights granted</span>
  <span class="s0">herein, subject to the following conditions:</span>

    <span class="s0">o Redistribution of  source code  must retain this  license file</span>
      <span class="s0">(`FTL.TXT') unaltered; any  additions, deletions or changes to</span>
      <span class="s0">the original  files must be clearly  indicated in accompanying</span>
      <span class="s0">documentation.   The  copyright   notices  of  the  unaltered,</span>
      <span class="s0">original  files must  be  preserved in  all  copies of  source</span>
      <span class="s0">files.</span>

    <span class="s0">o Redistribution in binary form must provide a  disclaimer  that</span>
      <span class="s0">states  that  the software is based in part of the work of the</span>
      <span class="s0">FreeType Team,  in  the  distribution  documentation.  We also</span>
      <span class="s0">encourage you to put an URL to the FreeType web page  in  your</span>
      <span class="s0">documentation, though this isn't mandatory.</span>

  <span class="s0">These conditions  apply to any  software derived from or  based on</span>
  <span class="s0">the FreeType Project,  not just the unmodified files.   If you use</span>
  <span class="s0">our work, you  must acknowledge us.  However, no  fee need be paid</span>
  <span class="s0">to us.</span>

<span class="s0">3. Advertising</span>

  <span class="s0">Neither the  FreeType authors and  contributors nor you  shall use</span>
  <span class="s0">the name of the  other for commercial, advertising, or promotional</span>
  <span class="s0">purposes without specific prior written permission.</span>

  <span class="s0">We suggest,  but do not require, that  you use one or  more of the</span>
  <span class="s0">following phrases to refer  to this software in your documentation</span>
  <span class="s0">or advertising  materials: `FreeType Project',  `FreeType Engine',</span>
  <span class="s0">`FreeType library', or `FreeType Distribution'.</span>

  <span class="s0">As  you have  not signed  this license,  you are  not  required to</span>
  <span class="s0">accept  it.   However,  as  the FreeType  Project  is  copyrighted</span>
  <span class="s0">material, only  this license, or  another one contracted  with the</span>
  <span class="s0">authors, grants you  the right to use, distribute,  and modify it.</span>
  <span class="s0">Therefore,  by  using,  distributing,  or modifying  the  FreeType</span>
  <span class="s0">Project, you indicate that you understand and accept all the terms</span>
  <span class="s0">of this license.</span>

   <span class="s0">3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of</span>
      <span class="s0">this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,</span>

      <span class="s0">or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct</span>
      <span class="s0">or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses</span>
      <span class="s0">granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate</span>
      <span class="s0">as of the date such litigation is filed.</span>

   <span class="s0">4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the</span>

          <span class="s0">Derivative Works a copy of this License; and</span>

      <span class="s0">(b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices</span>
          <span class="s0">stating that You changed the files; and</span>

      <span class="s0">(c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works</span>

          <span class="s0">excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of</span>
          <span class="s0">the Derivative Works; and</span>

      <span class="s0">(d) If the Work includes a &quot;NOTICE&quot; text file as part of its</span>
          <span class="s0">distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must</span>
          <span class="s0">include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained</span>

          <span class="s0">of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed</span>
          <span class="s0">as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or</span>

          <span class="s0">wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents</span>
          <span class="s0">of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and</span>
          <span class="s0">do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution</span>

          <span class="s0">or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided</span>
          <span class="s0">that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed</span>
          <span class="s0">as modifying the License.</span>

      <span class="s0">You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and</span>
      <span class="s0">may provide additional or different license terms and conditions</span>
      <span class="s0">for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or</span>
      <span class="s0">for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,</span>
      <span class="s0">reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with</span>
      <span class="s0">the conditions stated in this License.</span>

   <span class="s0">5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,</span>
      <span class="s0">any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work</span>
      <span class="s0">by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of</span>
      <span class="s0">this License, without any additional terms or conditions.</span>
      <span class="s0">Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify</span>
      <span class="s0">the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed</span>
      <span class="s0">with Licensor regarding such Contributions.</span>

   <span class="s0">6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade</span>
      <span class="s0">names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,</span>
      <span class="s0">except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the</span>
      <span class="s0">origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.</span>

   <span class="s0">7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or</span>
      <span class="s0">agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each</span>
      <span class="s0">Contributor provides its Contributions) on an &quot;AS IS&quot; BASIS,</span>
      <span class="s0">WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or</span>
      <span class="s0">implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions</span>
      <span class="s0">of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A</span>
      <span class="s0">PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the</span>

      <span class="s0">risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.</span>

   <span class="s0">8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,</span>
      <span class="s0">whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,</span>
      <span class="s0">unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly</span>
      <span class="s0">negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be</span>
      <span class="s0">liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,</span>
      <span class="s0">incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a</span>
      <span class="s0">result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the</span>
      <span class="s0">Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,</span>
      <span class="s0">work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all</span>
      <span class="s0">other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor</span>
      <span class="s0">has been advised of the possibility of such damages.</span>

   <span class="s0">9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing</span>
      <span class="s0">the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,</span>
      <span class="s0">and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,</span>
      <span class="s0">or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this</span>
      <span class="s0">License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only</span>
      <span class="s0">on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf</span>
      <span class="s0">of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,</span>
      <span class="s0">defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability</span>
      <span class="s0">incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason</span>
      <span class="s0">of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.</span>

   <span class="s0">END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS</span>

<span class="s0">by Rich Felker, the main author of the library, or by one or more</span>
<span class="s0">contibutors listed above. Details on authorship of individual files</span>
<span class="s0">can be found in the git version control history of the project. The</span>
<span class="s0">omission of copyright and license comments in each file is in the</span>
<span class="s0">interest of source tree size.</span>

<span class="s0">This file previously contained text expressing a belief that most of</span>
<span class="s0">the files covered by the above exception were sufficiently trivial not</span>

<span class="s0">negated the permissions granted in the license. In the spirit of</span>

<span class="s0">of or in connection with the use or performance of this software.</span>

<span class="s0">A large portion of the dictionary entries</span>
<span class="s0">originate from ICOT Free Software.  The following conditions for ICOT</span>
<span class="s0">Free Software applies to the current dictionary as well.</span>

<span class="s0">Each User may also freely distribute the Program, whether in its</span>
<span class="s0">original form or modified, to any third party or parties, PROVIDED</span>
<span class="s0">that the provisions of Section 3 (&quot;NO WARRANTY&quot;) will ALWAYS appear</span>
<span class="s0">on, or be attached to, the Program, which is distributed substantially</span>
<span class="s0">in the same form as set out herein and that such intended</span>
<span class="s0">distribution, if actually made, will neither violate or otherwise</span>
<span class="s0">contravene any of the laws and regulations of the countries having</span>
<span class="s0">jurisdiction over the User or the intended distribution itself.</span>

<span class="s0">NO WARRANTY</span>

<span class="s0">The program was produced on an experimental basis in the course of the</span>
<span class="s0">research and development conducted during the project and is provided</span>
<span class="s0">to users as so produced on an experimental basis.  Accordingly, the</span>
<span class="s0">program is provided without any warranty whatsoever, whether express,</span>
<span class="s0">implied, statutory or otherwise.  The term &quot;warranty&quot; used herein</span>
<span class="s0">includes, but is not limited to, any warranty of the quality,</span>
<span class="s0">performance, merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose of</span>
<span class="s0">the program and the nonexistence of any infringement or violation of</span>
<span class="s0">any right of any third party.</span>

<span class="s0">Each user of the program will agree and understand, and be deemed to</span>
<span class="s0">have agreed and understood, that there is no warranty whatsoever for</span>
<span class="s0">the program and, accordingly, the entire risk arising from or</span>
<span class="s0">otherwise connected with the program is assumed by the user.</span>

<span class="s0">Therefore, neither ICOT, the copyright holder, or any other</span>
<span class="s0">organization that participated in or was otherwise related to the</span>
<span class="s0">development of the program and their respective officials, directors,</span>
<span class="s0">officers and other employees shall be held liable for any and all</span>
<span class="s0">damages, including, without limitation, general, special, incidental</span>
<span class="s0">and consequential damages, arising out of or otherwise in connection</span>
<span class="s0">with the use or inability to use the program or any product, material</span>
<span class="s0">or result produced or otherwise obtained by using the program,</span>
<span class="s0">regardless of whether they have been advised of, or otherwise had</span>
<span class="s0">knowledge of, the possibility of such damages at any time during the</span>
<span class="s0">project or thereafter.  Each user will be deemed to have agreed to the</span>
<span class="s0">foregoing by his or her commencement of use of the program.  The term</span>
<span class="s0">&quot;use&quot; as used herein includes, but is not limited to, the use,</span>
<span class="s0">modification, copying and distribution of the program and the</span>
<span class="s0">production of secondary products from the program.</span>

<span class="s0">In the case where the program, whether in its original form or</span>
<span class="s0">modified, was distributed or delivered to or received by a user from</span>
<span class="s0">any person, organization or entity other than ICOT, unless it makes or</span>
<span class="s0">grants independently of ICOT any specific warranty to the user in</span>
<span class="s0">writing, such person, organization or entity, will also be exempted</span>
<span class="s0">from and not be held liable to the user for any such damages as noted</span>
<span class="s0">above as far as the program is concerned.</span>

  <span class="s0">the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions</span>
  <span class="s0">to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally</span>
  <span class="s0">submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner</span>
  <span class="s0">or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of</span>
  <span class="s0">the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, &quot;submitted&quot;</span>
  <span class="s0">means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent</span>
  <span class="s0">to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to</span>
  <span class="s0">communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,</span>
  <span class="s0">and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the</span>
  <span class="s0">Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but</span>
  <span class="s0">excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise</span>
  <span class="s0">designated in writing by the copyright owner as &quot;Not a Contribution.&quot;</span>

  <span class="s0">&quot;Contributor&quot; shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity</span>
  <span class="s0">on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and</span>
  <span class="s0">subsequently incorporated within the Work.</span>

<span class="s0">2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of</span>
  <span class="s0">this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,</span>
  <span class="s0">worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable</span>
  <span class="s0">copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,</span>
  <span class="s0">publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the</span>
  <span class="s0">Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.</span>

<span class="s0">3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of</span>
  <span class="s0">this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,</span>
  <span class="s0">worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable</span>
  <span class="s0">(except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,</span>
  <span class="s0">use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,</span>
  <span class="s0">where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable</span>
  <span class="s0">by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their</span>
  <span class="s0">Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)</span>
  <span class="s0">with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You</span>
  <span class="s0">institute patent litigation against any entity (including a</span>
  <span class="s0">cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work</span>
  <span class="s0">or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct</span>
  <span class="s0">or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses</span>
  <span class="s0">granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate</span>
  <span class="s0">as of the date such litigation is filed.</span>

<span class="s0">4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the</span>
  <span class="s0">Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without</span>
  <span class="s0">modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You</span>
  <span class="s0">meet the following conditions:</span>

  <span class="s0">(a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or</span>
      <span class="s0">Derivative Works a copy of this License; and</span>

  <span class="s0">(b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices</span>
      <span class="s0">stating that You changed the files; and</span>

  <span class="s0">(c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works</span>
      <span class="s0">that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and</span>
      <span class="s0">attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,</span>
      <span class="s0">excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of</span>
      <span class="s0">the Derivative Works; and</span>

  <span class="s0">(d) If the Work includes a &quot;NOTICE&quot; text file as part of its</span>
      <span class="s0">distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must</span>
      <span class="s0">include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained</span>
      <span class="s0">within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not</span>
      <span class="s0">pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one</span>
      <span class="s0">of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed</span>
      <span class="s0">as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or</span>
      <span class="s0">documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,</span>
      <span class="s0">within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and</span>
      <span class="s0">wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents</span>
      <span class="s0">of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and</span>
      <span class="s0">do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution</span>
      <span class="s0">notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside</span>
      <span class="s0">or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided</span>
      <span class="s0">that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed</span>
      <span class="s0">as modifying the License.</span>

  <span class="s0">You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and</span>
  <span class="s0">may provide additional or different license terms and conditions</span>
  <span class="s0">for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or</span>
  <span class="s0">for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,</span>
  <span class="s0">reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with</span>
  <span class="s0">the conditions stated in this License.</span>

<span class="s0">5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,</span>
  <span class="s0">any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work</span>
  <span class="s0">by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of</span>
  <span class="s0">this License, without any additional terms or conditions.</span>
  <span class="s0">Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify</span>
  <span class="s0">the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed</span>
  <span class="s0">with Licensor regarding such Contributions.</span>

<span class="s0">6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade</span>
  <span class="s0">names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,</span>
  <span class="s0">except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the</span>
  <span class="s0">origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.</span>

<span class="s0">7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or</span>
  <span class="s0">agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each</span>
  <span class="s0">Contributor provides its Contributions) on an &quot;AS IS&quot; BASIS,</span>
  <span class="s0">WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or</span>
  <span class="s0">implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions</span>
  <span class="s0">of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A</span>
  <span class="s0">PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the</span>
  <span class="s0">appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any</span>
  <span class="s0">risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.</span>

<span class="s0">8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,</span>
  <span class="s0">whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,</span>
  <span class="s0">unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly</span>
  <span class="s0">negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be</span>
  <span class="s0">liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,</span>
  <span class="s0">incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a</span>
  <span class="s0">result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the</span>
  <span class="s0">Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,</span>
  <span class="s0">work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all</span>
  <span class="s0">other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor</span>
  <span class="s0">has been advised of the possibility of such damages.</span>

<span class="s0">9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing</span>
  <span class="s0">the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,</span>
  <span class="s0">and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,</span>
  <span class="s0">or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this</span>
  <span class="s0">License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only</span>
  <span class="s0">on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf</span>
  <span class="s0">of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,</span>
  <span class="s0">defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability</span>
  <span class="s0">incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason</span>
  <span class="s0">of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.</span>

<span class="s0">out where to obtain the FAQ article.</span>

<span class="s0">If you want to understand how the JPEG code works, we suggest reading one or</span>
<span class="s0">more of the REFERENCES, then looking at the documentation files (in roughly</span>
<span class="s0">the order listed) before diving into the code.</span>

<span class="s0">OVERVIEW</span>
<span class="s0">========</span>

<span class="s0">This package contains C software to implement JPEG image encoding, decoding,</span>
<span class="s0">and transcoding.  JPEG (pronounced &quot;jay-peg&quot;) is a standardized compression</span>
<span class="s0">method for full-color and grayscale images.  JPEG's strong suit is compressing</span>
<span class="s0">photographic images or other types of images that have smooth color and</span>
<span class="s0">brightness transitions between neighboring pixels.  Images with sharp lines or</span>
<span class="s0">other abrupt features may not compress well with JPEG, and a higher JPEG</span>
<span class="s0">quality may have to be used to avoid visible compression artifacts with such</span>
<span class="s0">images.</span>

<span class="s0">JPEG is lossy, meaning that the output pixels are not necessarily identical to</span>
<span class="s0">the input pixels.  However, on photographic content and other &quot;smooth&quot; images,</span>
<span class="s0">very good compression ratios can be obtained with no visible compression</span>
<span class="s0">artifacts, and extremely high compression ratios are possible if you are</span>
<span class="s0">willing to sacrifice image quality (by reducing the &quot;quality&quot; setting in the</span>
<span class="s0">compressor.)</span>

<span class="s0">This software implements JPEG baseline, extended-sequential, and progressive</span>
<span class="s0">compression processes.  Provision is made for supporting all variants of these</span>
<span class="s0">processes, although some uncommon parameter settings aren't implemented yet.</span>
<span class="s0">We have made no provision for supporting the hierarchical or lossless</span>
<span class="s0">processes defined in the standard.</span>

<span class="s0">We provide a set of library routines for reading and writing JPEG image files,</span>
<span class="s0">plus two sample applications &quot;cjpeg&quot; and &quot;djpeg&quot;, which use the library to</span>
<span class="s0">perform conversion between JPEG and some other popular image file formats.</span>
<span class="s0">The library is intended to be reused in other applications.</span>

<span class="s0">In order to support file conversion and viewing software, we have included</span>
<span class="s0">considerable functionality beyond the bare JPEG coding/decoding capability;</span>
<span class="s0">for example, the color quantization modules are not strictly part of JPEG</span>
<span class="s0">decoding, but they are essential for output to colormapped file formats or</span>
<span class="s0">colormapped displays.  These extra functions can be compiled out of the</span>
<span class="s0">library if not required for a particular application.</span>

<span class="s0">We have also included &quot;jpegtran&quot;, a utility for lossless transcoding between</span>
<span class="s0">different JPEG processes, and &quot;rdjpgcom&quot; and &quot;wrjpgcom&quot;, two simple</span>
<span class="s0">applications for inserting and extracting textual comments in JFIF files.</span>

<span class="s0">The emphasis in designing this software has been on achieving portability and</span>
<span class="s0">flexibility, while also making it fast enough to be useful.  In particular,</span>
<span class="s0">the software is not intended to be read as a tutorial on JPEG.  (See the</span>
<span class="s0">REFERENCES section for introductory material.)  Rather, it is intended to</span>
<span class="s0">be reliable, portable, industrial-strength code.  We do not claim to have</span>
<span class="s0">achieved that goal in every aspect of the software, but we strive for it.</span>

<span class="s0">We welcome the use of this software as a component of commercial products.</span>
<span class="s0">No royalty is required, but we do ask for an acknowledgement in product</span>
<span class="s0">documentation, as described under LEGAL ISSUES.</span>

<span class="s0">REFERENCES</span>
<span class="s0">==========</span>

<span class="s0">We recommend reading one or more of these references before trying to</span>
<span class="s0">understand the innards of the JPEG software.</span>

<span class="s0">The best short technical introduction to the JPEG compression algorithm is</span>
	<span class="s0">Wallace, Gregory K.  &quot;The JPEG Still Picture Compression Standard&quot;,</span>
	<span class="s0">Communications of the ACM, April 1991 (vol. 34 no. 4), pp. 30-44.</span>
<span class="s0">(Adjacent articles in that issue discuss MPEG motion picture compression,</span>
<span class="s0">applications of JPEG, and related topics.)  If you don't have the CACM issue</span>
<span class="s0">handy, a PDF file containing a revised version of Wallace's article is</span>
<span class="s0">available at http://www.ijg.org/files/Wallace.JPEG.pdf.  The file (actually</span>
<span class="s0">a preprint for an article that appeared in IEEE Trans. Consumer Electronics)</span>
<span class="s0">omits the sample images that appeared in CACM, but it includes corrections</span>
<span class="s0">and some added material.  Note: the Wallace article is copyright ACM and IEEE,</span>
<span class="s0">and it may not be used for commercial purposes.</span>

<span class="s0">A somewhat less technical, more leisurely introduction to JPEG can be found in</span>
<span class="s0">&quot;The Data Compression Book&quot; by Mark Nelson and Jean-loup Gailly, published by</span>
<span class="s0">M&amp;T Books (New York), 2nd ed. 1996, ISBN 1-55851-434-1.  This book provides</span>
<span class="s0">good explanations and example C code for a multitude of compression methods</span>
<span class="s0">including JPEG.  It is an excellent source if you are comfortable reading C</span>
<span class="s0">code but don't know much about data compression in general.  The book's JPEG</span>
<span class="s0">sample code is far from industrial-strength, but when you are ready to look</span>
<span class="s0">at a full implementation, you've got one here...</span>

<span class="s0">The best currently available description of JPEG is the textbook &quot;JPEG Still</span>
<span class="s0">Image Data Compression Standard&quot; by William B. Pennebaker and Joan L.</span>
<span class="s0">Mitchell, published by Van Nostrand Reinhold, 1993, ISBN 0-442-01272-1.</span>
<span class="s0">Price US$59.95, 638 pp.  The book includes the complete text of the ISO JPEG</span>
<span class="s0">standards (DIS 10918-1 and draft DIS 10918-2).</span>

<span class="s0">The original JPEG standard is divided into two parts, Part 1 being the actual</span>
<span class="s0">specification, while Part 2 covers compliance testing methods.  Part 1 is</span>
<span class="s0">titled &quot;Digital Compression and Coding of Continuous-tone Still Images,</span>
<span class="s0">Part 1: Requirements and guidelines&quot; and has document numbers ISO/IEC IS</span>
<span class="s0">10918-1, ITU-T T.81.  Part 2 is titled &quot;Digital Compression and Coding of</span>
<span class="s0">Continuous-tone Still Images, Part 2: Compliance testing&quot; and has document</span>
<span class="s0">numbers ISO/IEC IS 10918-2, ITU-T T.83.</span>

<span class="s0">The JPEG standard does not specify all details of an interchangeable file</span>
<span class="s0">format.  For the omitted details we follow the &quot;JFIF&quot; conventions, revision</span>
<span class="s0">1.02.  JFIF 1.02 has been adopted as an Ecma International Technical Report</span>
<span class="s0">and thus received a formal publication status.  It is available as a free</span>
<span class="s0">download in PDF format from</span>
<span class="s0">http://www.ecma-international.org/publications/techreports/E-TR-098.htm.</span>
<span class="s0">A PostScript version of the JFIF document is available at</span>
<span class="s0">http://www.ijg.org/files/jfif.ps.gz.  There is also a plain text version at</span>
<span class="s0">http://www.ijg.org/files/jfif.txt.gz, but it is missing the figures.</span>

<span class="s0">The TIFF 6.0 file format specification can be obtained by FTP from</span>
<span class="s0">ftp://ftp.sgi.com/graphics/tiff/TIFF6.ps.gz.  The JPEG incorporation scheme</span>
<span class="s0">found in the TIFF 6.0 spec of 3-June-92 has a number of serious problems.</span>
<span class="s0">IJG does not recommend use of the TIFF 6.0 design (TIFF Compression tag 6).</span>
<span class="s0">Instead, we recommend the JPEG design proposed by TIFF Technical Note #2</span>
<span class="s0">(Compression tag 7).  Copies of this Note can be obtained from</span>
<span class="s0">http://www.ijg.org/files/.  It is expected that the next revision</span>
<span class="s0">of the TIFF spec will replace the 6.0 JPEG design with the Note's design.</span>
<span class="s0">Although IJG's own code does not support TIFF/JPEG, the free libtiff library</span>
<span class="s0">uses our library to implement TIFF/JPEG per the Note.</span>

<span class="s0">FILE FORMAT WARS</span>
<span class="s0">================</span>

<span class="s0">The ISO/IEC JTC1/SC29/WG1 standards committee (also known as JPEG, together</span>
<span class="s0">with ITU-T SG16) currently promotes different formats containing the name</span>
<span class="s0">&quot;JPEG&quot; which are incompatible with original DCT-based JPEG.  IJG therefore does</span>
<span class="s0">not support these formats (see REFERENCES).  Indeed, one of the original</span>
<span class="s0">reasons for developing this free software was to help force convergence on</span>
<span class="s0">common, interoperable format standards for JPEG files.</span>
<span class="s0">Don't use an incompatible file format!</span>
<span class="s0">(In any case, our decoder will remain capable of reading existing JPEG</span>
<span class="s0">image files indefinitely.)</span>

<span class="s0">TO DO</span>
<span class="s0">=====</span>

<span class="s0">Please send bug reports, offers of help, etc. to jpeg-info@jpegclub.org.</span>

    <span class="s0">a. under intellectual property rights (other than patent or trademark) Licensable by such Contributor to use, reproduce, make available, modify, display, perform, distribute, and otherwise exploit its Contributions, either on an unmodified basis, with Modifications, or as part of a Larger Work; and</span>

<span class="s0">2.2. Effective Date</span>

<span class="s0">The licenses granted in Section 2.1 with respect to any Contribution become effective for each Contribution on the date the Contributor first distributes such Contribution.</span>

<span class="s0">2.3. Limitations on Grant Scope</span>

<span class="s0">The licenses granted in this Section 2 are the only rights granted under this License. No additional rights or licenses will be implied from the distribution or licensing of Covered Software under this License. Notwithstanding Section 2.1(b) above, no patent license is granted by a Contributor:</span>

    <span class="s0">a. for any code that a Contributor has removed from Covered Software; or</span>

    <span class="s0">b. for infringements caused by: (i) Your and any other third party’s modifications of Covered Software, or (ii) the combination of its Contributions with other software (except as part of its Contributor Version); or</span>

    <span class="s0">c. under Patent Claims infringed by Covered Software in the absence of its Contributions.</span>

<span class="s0">This License does not grant any rights in the trademarks, service marks, or logos of any Contributor (except as may be necessary to comply with the notice requirements in Section 3.4).</span>

<span class="s0">2.4. Subsequent Licenses</span>

<span class="s0">No Contributor makes additional grants as a result of Your choice to distribute the Covered Software under a subsequent version of this License (see Section 10.2) or under the terms of a Secondary License (if permitted under the terms of Section 3.3).</span>

<span class="s0">2.5. Representation</span>

<span class="s0">Each Contributor represents that the Contributor believes its Contributions are its original creation(s) or it has sufficient rights to grant the rights to its Contributions conveyed by this License.</span>

<span class="s0">2.6. Fair Use</span>

<span class="s0">This License is not intended to limit any rights You have under applicable copyright doctrines of fair use, fair dealing, or other equivalents.</span>

<span class="s0">2.7. Conditions</span>

<span class="s0">Sections 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, and 3.4 are conditions of the licenses granted in Section 2.1.</span>

<span class="s0">3. Responsibilities</span>

<span class="s0">3.1. Distribution of Source Form</span>

<span class="s0">All distribution of Covered Software in Source Code Form, including any Modifications that You create or to which You contribute, must be under the terms of this License. You must inform recipients that the Source Code Form of the Covered Software is governed by the terms of this License, and how they can obtain a copy of this License. You may not attempt to alter or restrict the recipients’ rights in the Source Code Form.</span>

<span class="s0">3.2. Distribution of Executable Form</span>

<span class="s0">If You distribute Covered Software in Executable Form then:</span>

    <span class="s0">a. such Covered Software must also be made available in Source Code Form, as described in Section 3.1, and You must inform recipients of the Executable Form how they can obtain a copy of such Source Code Form by reasonable means in a timely manner, at a charge no more than the cost of distribution to the recipient; and</span>

    <span class="s0">b. You may distribute such Executable Form under the terms of this License, or sublicense it under different terms, provided that the license for the Executable Form does not attempt to limit or alter the recipients’ rights in the Source Code Form under this License.</span>

<span class="s0">3.3. Distribution of a Larger Work</span>

<span class="s0">You may create and distribute a Larger Work under terms of Your choice, provided that You also comply with the requirements of this License for the Covered Software. If the Larger Work is a combination of Covered Software with a work governed by one or more Secondary Licenses, and the Covered Software is not Incompatible With Secondary Licenses, this License permits You to additionally distribute such Covered Software under the terms of such Secondary License(s), so that the recipient of the Larger Work may, at their option, further distribute the Covered Software under the terms of either this License or such Secondary License(s).</span>

<span class="s0">3.4. Notices</span>

<span class="s0">You may not remove or alter the substance of any license notices (including copyright notices, patent notices, disclaimers of warranty, or limitations of liability) contained within the Source Code Form of the Covered Software, except that You may alter any license notices to the extent required to remedy known factual inaccuracies.</span>

<span class="s0">3.5. Application of Additional Terms</span>

<span class="s0">You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients of Covered Software. However, You may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on behalf of any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear that any such warranty, support, indemnity, or liability obligation is offered by You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify every Contributor for any liability incurred by such Contributor as a result of warranty, support, indemnity or liability terms You offer. You may include additional disclaimers of warranty and limitations of liability specific to any jurisdiction.</span>

<span class="s0">4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation</span>

<span class="s0">If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this License with respect to some or all of the Covered Software due to statute, judicial order, or regulation then You must: (a) comply with the terms of this License to the maximum extent possible; and (b) describe the limitations and the code they affect. Such description must be placed in a text file included with all distributions of the Covered Software under this License. Except to the extent prohibited by statute or regulation, such description must be sufficiently detailed for a recipient of ordinary skill to be able to understand it.</span>

<span class="s0">5. Termination</span>

<span class="s0">5.1. The rights granted under this License will terminate automatically if You fail to comply with any of its terms. However, if You become compliant, then the rights granted under this License from a particular Contributor are reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and until such Contributor explicitly and finally terminates Your grants, and (b) on an ongoing basis, if such Contributor fails to notify You of the non-compliance by some reasonable means prior to 60 days after You have come back into compliance. Moreover, Your grants from a particular Contributor are reinstated on an ongoing basis if such Contributor notifies You of the non-compliance by some reasonable means, this is the first time You have received notice of non-compliance with this License from such Contributor, and You become compliant prior to 30 days after Your receipt of the notice.</span>

<span class="s0">5.2. If You initiate litigation against any entity by asserting a patent infringement claim (excluding declaratory judgment actions, counter-claims, and cross-claims) alleging that a Contributor Version directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then the rights granted to You by any and all Contributors for the Covered Software under Section 2.1 of this License shall terminate.</span>

<span class="s0">5.3. In the event of termination under Sections 5.1 or 5.2 above, all end user license agreements (excluding distributors and resellers) which have been validly granted by You or Your distributors under this License prior to termination shall survive termination.</span>

<span class="s0">6. Disclaimer of Warranty</span>

    <span class="s0">Covered Software is provided under this License on an “as is” basis, without warranty of any kind, either expressed, implied, or statutory, including, without limitation, warranties that the Covered Software is free of defects, merchantable, fit for a particular purpose or non-infringing. The entire risk as to the quality and performance of the Covered Software is with You. Should any Covered Software prove defective in any respect, You (not any Contributor) assume the cost of any necessary servicing, repair, or correction. This disclaimer of warranty constitutes an essential part of this License. No use of any Covered Software is authorized under this License except under this disclaimer.</span>

<span class="s0">7. Limitation of Liability</span>

    <span class="s0">Under no circumstances and under no legal theory, whether tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise, shall any Contributor, or anyone who distributes Covered Software as permitted above, be liable to You for any direct, indirect, special, incidental, or consequential damages of any character including, without limitation, damages for lost profits, loss of goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all other commercial damages or losses, even if such party shall have been informed of the possibility of such damages. This limitation of liability shall not apply to liability for death or personal injury resulting from such party’s negligence to the extent applicable law prohibits such limitation. Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of incidental or consequential damages, so this exclusion and limitation may not apply to You.</span>

<span class="s0">8. Litigation</span>

<span class="s0">Any litigation relating to this License may be brought only in the courts of a jurisdiction where the defendant maintains its principal place of business and such litigation shall be governed by laws of that jurisdiction, without reference to its conflict-of-law provisions. Nothing in this Section shall prevent a party’s ability to bring cross-claims or counter-claims.</span>

<span class="s0">9. Miscellaneous</span>

<span class="s0">This License represents the complete agreement concerning the subject matter hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent necessary to make it enforceable. Any law or regulation which provides that the language of a contract shall be construed against the drafter shall not be used to construe this License against a Contributor.</span>

<span class="s0">10.2. Effect of New Versions</span>

<span class="s0">2.3. Limitations on Grant Scope</span>

<span class="s0">The licenses granted in this Section 2 are the only rights granted under</span>

<span class="s0">License (see Section 10.2) or under the terms of a Secondary License (if</span>
<span class="s0">permitted under the terms of Section 3.3).</span>

<span class="s0">2.5. Representation</span>

<span class="s0">Each Contributor represents that the Contributor believes its</span>
<span class="s0">Contributions are its original creation(s) or it has sufficient rights</span>
<span class="s0">to grant the rights to its Contributions conveyed by this License.</span>

<span class="s0">2.6. Fair Use</span>

<span class="s0">This License is not intended to limit any rights You have under</span>

<span class="s0">3.1. Distribution of Source Form</span>

<span class="s0">All distribution of Covered Software in Source Code Form, including any</span>
<span class="s0">Modifications that You create or to which You contribute, must be under</span>
<span class="s0">the terms of this License. You must inform recipients that the Source</span>
<span class="s0">Code Form of the Covered Software is governed by the terms of this</span>
<span class="s0">License, and how they can obtain a copy of this License. You may not</span>
<span class="s0">attempt to alter or restrict the recipients' rights in the Source Code</span>
<span class="s0">Form.</span>

<span class="s0">3.2. Distribution of Executable Form</span>

<span class="s0">If You distribute Covered Software in Executable Form then:</span>

<span class="s0">(a) such Covered Software must also be made available in Source Code</span>
    <span class="s0">Form, as described in Section 3.1, and You must inform recipients of</span>
    <span class="s0">the Executable Form how they can obtain a copy of such Source Code</span>
    <span class="s0">Form by reasonable means in a timely manner, at a charge no more</span>
    <span class="s0">than the cost of distribution to the recipient; and</span>

<span class="s0">(b) You may distribute such Executable Form under the terms of this</span>
    <span class="s0">License, or sublicense it under different terms, provided that the</span>
    <span class="s0">license for the Executable Form does not attempt to limit or alter</span>
    <span class="s0">the recipients' rights in the Source Code Form under this License.</span>

<span class="s0">3.3. Distribution of a Larger Work</span>

<span class="s0">You may create and distribute a Larger Work under terms of Your choice,</span>
<span class="s0">provided that You also comply with the requirements of this License for</span>
<span class="s0">the Covered Software. If the Larger Work is a combination of Covered</span>
<span class="s0">Software with a work governed by one or more Secondary Licenses, and the</span>
<span class="s0">Covered Software is not Incompatible With Secondary Licenses, this</span>
<span class="s0">License permits You to additionally distribute such Covered Software</span>
<span class="s0">under the terms of such Secondary License(s), so that the recipient of</span>
<span class="s0">the Larger Work may, at their option, further distribute the Covered</span>
<span class="s0">Software under the terms of either this License or such Secondary</span>
<span class="s0">License(s).</span>

<span class="s0">3.4. Notices</span>

<span class="s0">You may not remove or alter the substance of any license notices</span>
<span class="s0">(including copyright notices, patent notices, disclaimers of warranty,</span>
<span class="s0">or limitations of liability) contained within the Source Code Form of</span>
<span class="s0">the Covered Software, except that You may alter any license notices to</span>
<span class="s0">the extent required to remedy known factual inaccuracies.</span>

<span class="s0">3.5. Application of Additional Terms</span>

<span class="s0">You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support,</span>
<span class="s0">indemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients of Covered</span>
<span class="s0">Software. However, You may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on</span>
<span class="s0">behalf of any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear that any</span>
<span class="s0">such warranty, support, indemnity, or liability obligation is offered by</span>
<span class="s0">You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify every Contributor for any</span>
<span class="s0">liability incurred by such Contributor as a result of warranty, support,</span>
<span class="s0">indemnity or liability terms You offer. You may include additional</span>
<span class="s0">disclaimers of warranty and limitations of liability specific to any</span>
<span class="s0">jurisdiction.</span>

<span class="s0">4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation</span>

<span class="s0">If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this</span>
<span class="s0">License with respect to some or all of the Covered Software due to</span>
<span class="s0">statute, judicial order, or regulation then You must: (a) comply with</span>
<span class="s0">the terms of this License to the maximum extent possible; and (b)</span>
<span class="s0">describe the limitations and the code they affect. Such description must</span>
<span class="s0">be placed in a text file included with all distributions of the Covered</span>
<span class="s0">Software under this License. Except to the extent prohibited by statute</span>
<span class="s0">or regulation, such description must be sufficiently detailed for a</span>
<span class="s0">recipient of ordinary skill to be able to understand it.</span>

<span class="s0">5. Termination</span>

<span class="s0">5.1. The rights granted under this License will terminate automatically</span>
<span class="s0">if You fail to comply with any of its terms. However, if You become</span>
<span class="s0">compliant, then the rights granted under this License from a particular</span>
<span class="s0">Contributor are reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and until such</span>
<span class="s0">Contributor explicitly and finally terminates Your grants, and (b) on an</span>
<span class="s0">ongoing basis, if such Contributor fails to notify You of the</span>
<span class="s0">non-compliance by some reasonable means prior to 60 days after You have</span>
<span class="s0">come back into compliance. Moreover, Your grants from a particular</span>
<span class="s0">Contributor are reinstated on an ongoing basis if such Contributor</span>
<span class="s0">notifies You of the non-compliance by some reasonable means, this is the</span>
<span class="s0">first time You have received notice of non-compliance with this License</span>
<span class="s0">from such Contributor, and You become compliant prior to 30 days after</span>
<span class="s0">Your receipt of the notice.</span>

<span class="s0">5.2. If You initiate litigation against any entity by asserting a patent</span>
<span class="s0">infringement claim (excluding declaratory judgment actions,</span>
<span class="s0">counter-claims, and cross-claims) alleging that a Contributor Version</span>
<span class="s0">directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then the rights granted to</span>
<span class="s0">You by any and all Contributors for the Covered Software under Section</span>
<span class="s0">2.1 of this License shall terminate.</span>

<span class="s0">5.3. In the event of termination under Sections 5.1 or 5.2 above, all</span>
<span class="s0">end user license agreements (excluding distributors and resellers) which</span>
<span class="s0">have been validly granted by You or Your distributors under this License</span>
<span class="s0">prior to termination shall survive termination.</span>

<span class="s0">*  and all other commercial damages or losses, even if such party</span>
<span class="s0">*  shall have been informed of the possibility of such damages. This</span>
<span class="s0">*  limitation of liability shall not apply to liability for death or</span>
<span class="s0">*  personal injury resulting from such party's negligence to the</span>
<span class="s0">*  extent applicable law prohibits such limitation. Some</span>
<span class="s0">*  jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of</span>
<span class="s0">*  incidental or consequential damages, so this exclusion and</span>
<span class="s0">*  limitation may not apply to You.</span>

<span class="s0">8. Litigation</span>

<span class="s0">Any litigation relating to this License may be brought only in the</span>

<span class="s0">Nothing in this Section shall prevent a party's ability to bring</span>

<span class="s0">TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR USE, REPRODUCTION, AND DISTRIBUTION</span>

<span class="s0">1. Definitions.</span>

   <span class="s0">&quot;License&quot; shall mean the terms and conditions for use, reproduction,</span>

   <span class="s0">&quot;Legal Entity&quot; shall mean the union of the acting entity and all</span>
   <span class="s0">other entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common</span>
   <span class="s0">control with that entity. For the purposes of this definition,</span>
   <span class="s0">&quot;control&quot; means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the</span>

   <span class="s0">&quot;Derivative Works&quot; shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object</span>
   <span class="s0">form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the</span>
   <span class="s0">editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications</span>
   <span class="s0">represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes</span>
   <span class="s0">of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain</span>
   <span class="s0">separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,</span>
   <span class="s0">the Work and Derivative Works thereof.</span>

   <span class="s0">&quot;Contribution&quot; shall mean any work of authorship, including</span>
   <span class="s0">the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions</span>
   <span class="s0">to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally</span>
   <span class="s0">submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner</span>
   <span class="s0">or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of</span>
   <span class="s0">the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, &quot;submitted&quot;</span>

   <span class="s0">communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,</span>
   <span class="s0">and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the</span>

   <span class="s0">excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise</span>
   <span class="s0">designated in writing by the copyright owner as &quot;Not a Contribution.&quot;</span>

   <span class="s0">&quot;Contributor&quot; shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity</span>
   <span class="s0">on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and</span>
   <span class="s0">subsequently incorporated within the Work.</span>

<span class="s0">2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of</span>
   <span class="s0">this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,</span>
   <span class="s0">worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable</span>
   <span class="s0">copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,</span>
   <span class="s0">publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the</span>
   <span class="s0">Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.</span>

<span class="s0">3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of</span>
   <span class="s0">this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,</span>
   <span class="s0">worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable</span>
   <span class="s0">(except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,</span>
   <span class="s0">use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,</span>
   <span class="s0">where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable</span>
   <span class="s0">by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their</span>
   <span class="s0">Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)</span>
   <span class="s0">with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You</span>
   <span class="s0">institute patent litigation against any entity (including a</span>
   <span class="s0">cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work</span>
   <span class="s0">or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct</span>
   <span class="s0">or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses</span>
   <span class="s0">granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate</span>
   <span class="s0">as of the date such litigation is filed.</span>

<span class="s0">4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the</span>
   <span class="s0">Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without</span>
   <span class="s0">modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You</span>
   <span class="s0">meet the following conditions:</span>

   <span class="s0">(a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or</span>
       <span class="s0">Derivative Works a copy of this License; and</span>

   <span class="s0">(b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices</span>
       <span class="s0">stating that You changed the files; and</span>

   <span class="s0">(c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works</span>
       <span class="s0">that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and</span>
       <span class="s0">attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,</span>
       <span class="s0">excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of</span>
       <span class="s0">the Derivative Works; and</span>

   <span class="s0">(d) If the Work includes a &quot;NOTICE&quot; text file as part of its</span>
       <span class="s0">distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must</span>
       <span class="s0">include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained</span>
       <span class="s0">within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not</span>
       <span class="s0">pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one</span>
       <span class="s0">of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed</span>
       <span class="s0">as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or</span>
       <span class="s0">documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,</span>
       <span class="s0">within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and</span>
       <span class="s0">wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents</span>
       <span class="s0">of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and</span>
       <span class="s0">do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution</span>
       <span class="s0">notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside</span>
       <span class="s0">or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided</span>
       <span class="s0">that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed</span>
       <span class="s0">as modifying the License.</span>

   <span class="s0">You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and</span>
   <span class="s0">may provide additional or different license terms and conditions</span>
   <span class="s0">for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or</span>
   <span class="s0">for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,</span>
   <span class="s0">reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with</span>
   <span class="s0">the conditions stated in this License.</span>

<span class="s0">5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,</span>
   <span class="s0">any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work</span>
   <span class="s0">by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of</span>
   <span class="s0">this License, without any additional terms or conditions.</span>
   <span class="s0">Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify</span>
   <span class="s0">the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed</span>
   <span class="s0">with Licensor regarding such Contributions.</span>

<span class="s0">6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade</span>
   <span class="s0">names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,</span>
   <span class="s0">except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the</span>
   <span class="s0">origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.</span>

<span class="s0">7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or</span>
   <span class="s0">agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each</span>
   <span class="s0">Contributor provides its Contributions) on an &quot;AS IS&quot; BASIS,</span>
   <span class="s0">WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or</span>
   <span class="s0">implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions</span>
   <span class="s0">of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A</span>
   <span class="s0">PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the</span>
   <span class="s0">appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any</span>
   <span class="s0">risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.</span>

<span class="s0">8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,</span>
   <span class="s0">whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,</span>
   <span class="s0">unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly</span>
   <span class="s0">negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be</span>
   <span class="s0">liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,</span>
   <span class="s0">incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a</span>
   <span class="s0">result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the</span>
   <span class="s0">Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,</span>
   <span class="s0">work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all</span>
   <span class="s0">other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor</span>
   <span class="s0">has been advised of the possibility of such damages.</span>

<span class="s0">9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing</span>
   <span class="s0">the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,</span>
   <span class="s0">and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,</span>
   <span class="s0">or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this</span>
   <span class="s0">License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only</span>
   <span class="s0">on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf</span>
   <span class="s0">of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,</span>
   <span class="s0">defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability</span>
